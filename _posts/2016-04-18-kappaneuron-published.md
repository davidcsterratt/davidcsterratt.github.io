The paper describing
[KappaNEURON](https://github.com/davidcsterratt/KappaNEURON) that
Oksana Sorokina, Douglas Armstrong and I presented at the Workshop on
Hybrid Systems Biology 2014, Vienna and which has been already
published on the [arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4980) finally
appeared late last year in the proceedings volume.  The paper
describes an algorithm which incorporates stochastic rule-based models
into deterministic compartmental models of neurons, and presents our
implementation
([KappaNEURON](https://github.com/davidcsterratt/KappaNEURON)) of this
hybrid system using the SpatialKappa and NEURON simulators.
