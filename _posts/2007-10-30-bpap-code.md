This is the NEURON code for the manuscript "Synaptically-evoked
backpropagating action potentials can indicate synapse location in
hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells" by David C Sterratt and Arjen van
Ooyen.

To run the code:
1. Make sure NEURON is installed.
2. Download  <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/files/bpap.zip">this zip file</a>.
3. Unpack it. A directory called _bpap_ will be created.
4. Read README.txt in the _bpap_ directory.
