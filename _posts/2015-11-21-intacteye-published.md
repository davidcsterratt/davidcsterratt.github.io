Johannes Hjorth, Elise Savier, Michaël Reber, Stephen J. Eglen and I
have just published [a paper](http://bmcneurosci.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12868-015-0217-8) describing IntactEye, a software package
that uses two orthogonal images of the intact retina to locate focal
injections of a dye. This method is complementary to Retistruct: for
measuring several point injections it avoids having to create
distortions by flattening the retina.
