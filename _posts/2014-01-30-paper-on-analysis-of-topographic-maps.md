<a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/willshaw">David Willshaw</a>,
Adrianna Teriakidis and I have just published a <a
href="http://www.jneurosci.org/content/34/5/1791.abstract?etoc">paper
in the <em>Journal of Neuroscience</em></a> on analysis of topographic
maps. We have devised a new computational method entitled the "lattice
method" to analyse experimental data. Our method reveals that there is
hidden order in some maps that were previously thought to be
disordered.
