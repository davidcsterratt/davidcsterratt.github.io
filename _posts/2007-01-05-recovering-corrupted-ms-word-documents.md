If you have a corrupted Microsoft Word document that even MS Word
won't open, KWord for Linux may help you recover some of the
information. Simply try opening the document in
[KWord](http://www.koffice.org/kword/), and you may find some of your
text sandwiched between large amounts of junk characters. It probably
won't be formatted, but it might be there at least.
