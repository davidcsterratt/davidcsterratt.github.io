<a href="http://www.johanneshjorth.se">Johannes Hjorth</a> and I have
just pulished <a
href="http://journals.cambridge.org/repo_A90JlXNl">our short
commentary</a> on <a
href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22787061">Grimbert and Cang's
2012 model of the development of retinocollicular development</a>. Our
main point&nbsp; is that there appears to be an inconsistency between
some equations written in their Methods and the meaning of the
equations as described in the Results. Were the equations are
constructed as outlined in the Results, the model probably won't work
as advertised. There's also a bit of discussion about the meaning of
the word "permissive".
