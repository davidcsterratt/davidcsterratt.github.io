My colleagues Katharina Heil, Emilia Wysocka, Oksana Sorokina,
Jeanette Hellgren, Ian Simpson, Douglas Armstrong and I have published
a manuscript on
[bioRxiv](http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/254094v1) that
describes our work to determine how many of the the proteins found in
synapses have been included in computational, biophysical models of
synapses. The answer is not very many: We were able to map only 4.2%
of previously reported synaptic proteins to entities in biophysical
models.

We cross-linked the set of modelled proteins with sets of genes
associated with common neurological diseases. We find some examples ofo
disease-associated molecules that are well represented in models, such
as voltage-dependent calcium channel family (_CACNA1C_), dopamine D1
receptor, and glutamate ionotropic NMDA type 2A and 2B receptors. Many
other disease-associated genes have not been included in models of
synaptic plasticity, for example catechol-O-methyltransferase (_COMT_)
and _MAOA_. By incorporating pathway enrichment results, we identify
_LAMTOR_, a gene uniquely associated with Schizophrenia, which is
closely linked to the MAPK pathway found in some models.
