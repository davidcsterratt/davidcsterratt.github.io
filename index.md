I work as a research fellow with Douglas Armstrong at the Institute
for Adaptive and Neural Computation in the School of Informatics at
Edinburgh University.

My resarch interests are in the area of computational neuroscience and
include:

* Integration of rule-based models of biochemical networks with
  compartmental models.
* Development of the nervous system, in particular the development of
  the retinocollicular (or retinotectal) mapping
* Learning and memory, in particular asccociative networks
* Applications of compartmental modelling 

To find out more see my projects and code, or look up my github account.
