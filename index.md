I work as a research fellow with Douglas Armstrong at the Institute
for Adaptive and Neural Computation in the School of Informatics at
Edinburgh University.

## Research

My resarch interests are in the area of computational neuroscience and
include:

* Integration of rule-based models of biochemical networks with
  compartmental models.
* Development of the nervous system, in particular the development of
  the retinocollicular (or retinotectal) mapping
* Learning and memory, in particular asccociative networks
* Applications of compartmental modelling 

To find out more see my projects and code, or look up my github account.

## Software

### R packages I have written and maintain

* [Retistruct](http://retistruct.r-forge.r-project.org/) - 
* [geometry](http://geometry.r-forge.r-project.org/) provides R with
  an interface to convex hull and Delaunay triangulation functions of
  the qhull library
* [RImageJROI](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RImageJROI/index.html)
  Provides functions to read 'ImageJ' (http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/)
  Region of Interest (ROI) files, to plot the ROIs and to convert them
  to 'spatstat' (http://spatstat.org/) spatial patterns.
* RTriangle

### Multiscale modelling

* [KappaNEURON](https://github.com/davidcsterratt/KappaNEURON)

### Miscellaneous
