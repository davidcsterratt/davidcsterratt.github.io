# Retistruct and associated R packages

* [Retistruct](http://retistruct.r-forge.r-project.org/) is an R
  package I wrote to morph a flat surface with cuts (a dissected
  flat-mount retina) onto a curvilinear surface (the a standard
  retinal shape). 
* [geometry](http://geometry.r-forge.r-project.org/), which I maintain
  and develop, provides R with an interface to convex hull and
  Delaunay triangulation functions of the [qhull](http://www.qhull.org) library
* [RImageJROI](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RImageJROI/index.html)
  Provides functions to read [ImageJ](http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/)
  Region of Interest (ROI) files, to plot the ROIs and to convert them
  to [spatstat](http://spatstat.org/) spatial patterns.
* [RTriangle](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RTriangle/index.html)
  is a port I wrote to Jonathan Shewchuk's [Triangle library](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~quake/triangle.html) to R.

# Multiscale modelling

* [KappaNEURON](https://github.com/davidcsterratt/KappaNEURON)
  integrates the SpatialKappa rule-based simulator into NEURON.
